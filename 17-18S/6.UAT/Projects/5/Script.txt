Audience: UAT Staff
Problem: UAT categorized as "Senior Project"
Consequence: Very few freshman/sophomore take the course
Why is it this way: Prepare for job force? Previous experience
Alternative: Recommend freshman/sophomore take no "senior"
Why alternative is problematic: Some students may not have experience
What is solution: Recommend freshman/sophomore take not "senior"
What is the result: Course 6 students will be prepared for internships
Why care: head start on getting jobs 
Why hesitate: some freshman not ready
Who am I: freshman, interviewed for internships
Narrative: my application process (going to career fair)
By-Statement: getting freshman first internship by exposing them to UAT
Describe use case: getting an internship
Analogy: .......
Tagline: .........

"I'm sorry, what previous internship experience have you had?" As a freshman at
MIT's 2017 Fall Career Fair, my response was always, "Um, none?" Suffice to
say, I didn't receive any internship offers last semester. But with the skills
taught in 6.UAT, when Spring came, I was able to persuade my first-choice to
offer me a position. 

The concepts taught in 6.UAT are more applicable to freshman than the course
catalog indicates. As such, most course 6 majors don't take this class until 
their senior year. This results in a massive disservice to course 6 students 
as they lack the skills necessary to receive the best job experience early on.
Which would increase the quality of their future career.

By not classifying 6.UAT as a Senior Project and advertising the practical
applications in the course catalog, we can encourage underclassmen to take 
6.UAT. Resulting in a more prepared, experienced, and educated group of course
6 graduates.
