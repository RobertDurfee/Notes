"I'm sorry, but what previous internships did you say you've had?"

As a freshman in last semester's career fair, I was asked this question A LOT,
but, my answer was always, "Um, no exaperience?" Suffice to say, I didn't get
any job offers. Yet, only a few months later, I was able to persuade my first
choice company to offer me a summer position.  How did I do this? Using the
practical knowledge taught in 6.UAT.

Sadly, this is not the typical story for course six frehsman. Just look at the
class distribution of 6.UAT: the overwhelming majority of students are seniors!

Why? In the course catalog, 6.UAT is listed as a Senior Project.

This makes it very intimidating to select this course. After all, who am I, a
lowly freshman, to take a senior class at MIT? This must be blasphemy of the
highest order!

Luckily, this isn't nearly that profane as there is only one talk based on past
experience: the previous project talk. And, given the parameters of this talk,
any high school class involving a lab, project, or competition would satisfy!

So, Tony, lets change the course catalog. Don't list UAT as a senior class! We
can give freshman the tools they need to kickstart their career!
