Suppose we have a collection of objects with different characteristics (e.g.
multicolored shapes). We can keep a list of the characteristics of all the
objects in our collection. To know if a new object is not in our collection,
there will be a characteristic of the new object not on our list. Then the new
object must not be in our collection.

We can determine if a new object is not in a collection of other objects by
creating a list of all the characteristics of the collection, then comparing
the characteristics of the new object with the list. If the new object has a
characteristic not mentioned on our list, the object cannot be in the
collection.
