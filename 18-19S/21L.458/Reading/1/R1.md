# February 7th Reading

## Genesis 1

- What is meant by 'waters' in the context of 1:6-8? If there is supposed to be
waters above and below the sky, does it just mean non-rigid matter (gases and
liquids)?

- In 1:3, God creates light. But then later, in 1:16, God then creates the
lights (Sun and Moon) again. Is this a sort of consolidation of light?

- In 1:26, the text uses the pronoun 'us' when he creates humankind. Why is
'us' used and not some other pronoun? Or no pronoun at all?

- In 1:28 we are told to 'subdue' the earth and have 'dominion' over the plants
and animals. What does this entail? That we should protect and care for them
or reap them?

- In 1:29 it sounds like animals shouldn't eat other animals...

## Genesis 2

- It seems to me that 2:4 starts a flashback to the sixth day to talk more in
detail about creation. The naming of the animals appears to be an explanation
for the 'dominion' mentioned earlier.

- Why was it necessary to state that the man and woman were naked and felt no
shame in 2:25? It doesn't seem to fit.

## Genesis 3

- Perhaps the nakedness without shame was mentioned for the sake of 3:7 when
the fruit opened their eyes.

- Does the curse in 3:14 imply that snakes used to have legs?

- In 3:16, what does, 'your desire shall be for your husband,' mean?

- 3:18-19 continues to make it seem as though we should only each plants.

- Why does God not want man to eat from the Tree of Life an become immortal?

## Genesis 4

- After Cain kills Abel, is this when humans started eating meat? Since it
appears that Cain will no longer be able to farm. Does that imply eating meat
is sinful?

- In 4:17 where did Cain's wife come from? She is not named. Is this
incestuous?

- 4:26 states, 'At that time people began to invoke the name of the Lord.'
Does this mean people started asking God for things? Because people must have
been aware/praising God because Cain and Abel gave offerings.

### Genesis 5
