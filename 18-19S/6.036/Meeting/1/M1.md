## Sections

If a student needs to swap a section and need help, contact
`6.036-sections@mit.edu`.

## Helping Students

- Don't necessarily need to give them the answer, pose a question that leads
them into another direction.

- Try to help them in five minutes: get them to the next step.

- Point them to the lecture notes and ask them to reread something. If they
still don't understand, have them get back into the queue.

- Be kind!

## Help Queue

- Disclaim if you are unable to answer a question. Pass off to TA or staff.
