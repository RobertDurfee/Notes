# 6.036 Exercise 1

## 2) Classifier vs Hyperplane

1. I know this is a simple yes/no question, but both times I have tried doing
this problem, I have put the wrong answer. Is there a way we can be a little
more clear about the difference between a hyperplane and a classifier? (At
least before we have to look at the explanation.)

## 4) Separable Through Origin?

The name of the points in the instructions is werid... Maybe $(a_0, a_1)$ and
$(b_0, b_1)$? That way it's more clear that we aren't in $x$-$y$ coordinates.

Perhaps we should specify that a single point must be `-1` and another `+1`?
Or is part of the exercise to realize that two points with the same labels is
always separable through the origin?
