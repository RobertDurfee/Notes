# 6.036 Exercise 01

## 2) NumPy Introduction

### 2.1) Array

Maybe we could show the answer on multiple lines so it is obvious why the
dimensions make sense?

### 2.3) Shapes

6. Maybe we could remind them about single value tuples again?

### 2.6) Length

Should probably discuss the difference between a $1 \times 1$ NumPy array and
a scalar.

### 2.8) Indexing

Maybe we could teach them about `np.reshape`? It is really useful on more
complicated examples.

### 2.10) Matrix Multiplication

Maybe we could introduce `np.sum` along with the parameters `axis` and
`keepdims`?
