\section*{2 NumPy Introduction}

\subsection*{2.1 Array}

Maybe we could show the answer on multiple lines so it is obvious why the
dimensions make sense?

\subsection*{2.3 Shapes}

\subsubsection*{2.3f}

Maybe we could remind them about single value tuples again?

\subsection*{2.8 Indexing}

Maybe we could teach them about \texttt{np.reshape}? It is really useful on
more complicated examples.

\subsection*{2.10 Matrix Multiplication}

Maybe we could introduce \texttt{np.sum} along with \texttt{axis} and
\texttt{keepdims}?
