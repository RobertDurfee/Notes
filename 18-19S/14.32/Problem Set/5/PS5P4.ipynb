    "From this $t$-test, we can see the $p$-value is still equal to zero or, equivalently, that the confidence interval still does not include zero. Thus, it is safe to reject the null that marriage has no effect on weekly wages. From the coefficient, and individual who is married makes approximately 17\\% more on average than an individual who is not married. However, this is significantly lower than the naive estimate which suggests the effect of marriage on income is not nearly as strong as it first appears.\n",
