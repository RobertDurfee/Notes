## 4) Linear Regression with One Regressor

### 4.1) The Linear Regression Model

The model is defined using the equation

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + u_i $$

Where $Y$ is the dependent variable, $X$ is the independent variable (or
regressor), and $u$ is the error term. The $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are the
coefficients of the regression line. These are also known as the parameters.

### 4.2) Estimating the Coefficients of the Linear Regression Model

#### Ordinary Least Squares Estimator

Chooses the regression coefficients so that the estimated regression line is
as close as possible to the observed data, where closeness is measures by the
sum of the squared mistakes made in predicting $Y$ given $X$.
