\section{Application of Labor Supply Model}

How this matters in the real world with a real world example. Here we will be
looking at free trade in Vietnam, specifically child labor. There are
significant child abuse labor. They are deprived of their ability to go to
school and work at all ages. If we have free trade and more products will come
from China and thus, more child labor. But this may not be the case.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.33]{"Figure 1"}
    \caption{Rice Export Quotas in Vietnam}
\end{figure}

In \textit{Figure 1}, we have the market for rice. Lets say that the demand for
rice is $D_{w}$ and the price is $P_{w}$. Lets say that initially, Vietnam only
wants rice local. Therefore, they put in a quota where rice can only be supplied
to local consumers. This lowers demand and thus lowers price and quantity. We
will not look at this as good or bad, just as a shock to the model. 

This restriction was in place, but in the late 1990s, they removed this
restriction. What happens when you remove this restriction? People thought that
this would be bad for the children. In \textit{Figure 2} this is the market for
child labor in Vietnam. We start with $L_{1}$ child workers. Now we can sell to
others, the demand shifts out to $D_{2}$ so child worker quantity to $L_{2}$.
Now more children have to work. Why is this bad? Now the farm families get
richer. They will want more of everything. They will say, "I don't want my
children working in the rice fields anymore." Now there is a shift in the supply
curve. They will take children to education. The supply curve will shift in to
$S_{3}$, there is actually a decrease in child labor. If it only shifts to
$S_{2}$, child labor will still increase.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.33]{"Figure 2"}
    \caption{Child Labor in Vietnam}
\end{figure}

What actually happens? Dartmouth did a study of areas close to ocean (big
export) and areas near the interior (little export). Ocean had huge shocks,
interior had very little effect. What they found was that child labor went down.
Situation 4 in \textit{Figure 2} was what actually happened. This is a great
example of counter-intuitive model of economics.

\section{Labor Market Equilibrium}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.33]{"Figure 3"}
    \caption{Labor Market Equilibrium}
\end{figure}

We wanted to know where $w$ comes from. This comes from labor market equilibrium
in \textit{Figure 3}. Demand slope is downward sloping from diminishing marginal
revenue of labor. Lets assume income effects dominate substitution. Equilibrium
is then formed at point 1. This is where $w$ comes from.

\section{Minimum Wage Example}

This now allows us to study the phenomenon of minimum wage. This is the minimum
amount a company has to pay. In a standard model, this has the same effect as a
price ceiling. What would happen if a minimum wage was placed below equilibrium
(90\%). This would have no effect as it doesn't effect the robust equilibrium.

What if in \textit{Figure 4} there is a minimum wage above equilibrium? Consumer
surplus was $A+B+C$. Now,  only $L_{D}$ workers are hired. Now, consumer surplus
is $A$. Remember, we are the producers, and the firms are consumers. The workers
surplus has increased. $B$ is now completely transported to workers from firms.
However, society is now worse off. There is a deadweight loss from trades that
aren't being made. Higher wages lead to lower employment.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.33]{"Figure 4"}
    \caption{Labor Market with Minimum Wage}
\end{figure}

How big is this effect? Studies looked at minimum wage increases in adjacent
states. This has shown no effect on employment. How can that be? There are three
possible reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Minumum wage is not binding.} 
    
    But this is not true because it must be raised.
    
    \item \textbf{Maybe labor demand is inelastic. }
    
    Shown in \textit{Figure 5}. This means that a firm wants only to hire
    $L_{1}$ workers and will always want this for any reasonable wage. This is
    probably unrealistic overall.
    
    \item \textbf{Noncompetitive labor markets.}
    
    This means that labor markets aren't perfectly competitive.
    
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.33]{"Figure 5"}
    \caption{Labor Market with Inelastic Demand}
\end{figure}

What makes a market perfectly competitive? Many sellers and buyers. However,
workers may not have complete information about different jobs. Workers do not
like to switch jobs, either. This means that firms can have \textbf{monopsony}
where they can have market power over their workers. This means a firm can set
the wages for labor.

Firms make some surplus from their workers through monopsony. This allows firms
to pay workers less than their marginal revenue product:

$$w<MRP_{L}$$

This is parallel to the price being greater than marginal cost:

$$p>MC$$

If the minimum wage is less than the wage, no difference. If the minimum wage is
higher than the marginal revenue product, then we go to a classic situation. If
the minimum wage is in the range between wage and marginal revenue product, the
deadweight loss can be reduced. This government can be welfare improving. This
is the same analysis as with monopolies.

Is the minimum wage within this range? These past studies show that the minimum
wage is in this range. However, Seattle doubled the minimum wage. Studies showed
that there was a decline in labor. Workers are getting higher wages, but there
are fewer workers. Is this better? We need to establish a framework in terms of
equity or fairness.

\subsection{Company Towns}

There would be these huge towns isolated and you'd have to move and live there.
They had you and could exploit you. If you get lower wage, you wouldn't travel
hundreds of miles to go to a different town. As a result, monopsony power is
very realistic

\section{Capital Input Markets}

What is capital? Do not think about what capital is, but where is comes from.
Labor comes from taking leisure away from people. Capital comes from sacrificing
consumption. This is the \textbf{diversion of current consumption towards future
consumption.} Now we are talking about time. The stuff firms do and where do
they get the money to do it.

When you are a farmer and harvest grain, you can eat all now or use some to
replant next year. This is done by diverting current consumption. This allows
for next years' consumption. With market economy, it isn't this direct. Our
savings become capital. How does savings become capital? Through the capital
market. Just as decisions on how long to work determines labor, household
savings determine how much capital.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.33]{"Figure 6"}
    \caption{Equilibrium in Capital Markets}
\end{figure}

In \textit{Figure 6}, we have the capital equilibrium. The demand for capital is
a firm's demand for capital. This comes from setting the marginal revenue of
capital equal to the interest rate.

$$K^{*}=i^{*}$$

The demand is downward sloping because each machine is less productive. Where
does supply curve come from? The more people are paid to save, the more they
will save.

Capital supply, how much consumption am I willing to give up to ensure I have
consumption in the future. Savings is a bad. This means you can't have stuff
today. But we can't model bads. Therefore we model \textbf{second period
consumption}. Today you can consume $C_{1}$ in the future you can consume
$Y-C_{1}$.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.33]{"Figure 7"}
    \caption{Intertemporal Substitution}
\end{figure}

In \textit{Figure 7}, we model intertemporal substitution. If I save and receive
2\% interest, next year I have $1+2\%$ or $1+i$. This is the slope of the budget
constraint. The intercepts are determined by income.

The price of consuming today is the interest rate. The opportunity cost of
spending today is the ability to spend more tomorrow.

\subsection{Example}

I earn \$80,000. Next year I have an unpaid sybatical. Intercept on x-axis would
mean I have consumed all and saved none. Intercept on the y-axis, I don't spend
anything and next year I will have \$88,000. There should be an interior
solution. How do I decide? There is a utility function. This utility function
will intercept at tangency at optimal bundle of savings and consumption.


\subsection{Change in Interest}

The interest rate doubles in \textit{Figure 8}. What does this do to my
consumption and savings. We don't model savings, we model second period
consumption where savings can be derived later. Now there is a higher
opportunity cost in consuming in period one. Therefore, I will shift towards
more consumption period two through the substitution effect. However, I am now
richer and want even more and this include consumption in period one.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.33]{"Figure 8"}
    \caption{Intertemporal Substitution Through Increased Interest}
\end{figure}

Sometimes the income effect can offset the substitution and result in downward
sloping supply.
